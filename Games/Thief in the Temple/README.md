# Thief in the Temple

This was a final project for my Computer Game Development 1 course. My team was tasked with designing and creating a game.
We were allowed to use assets from the unity store and had less then a week to put it all together. 
We designed and created the player's charater. We had a friend of ours create the art, then i used that art to create an animation and proudce a sprite sheet.


## The Premise
You are a theif and you need to get through the temple to steal the treasure and escape. (hint: to unlock the path, you need to find the hidden pressure plate)

## How to Test Play
1. Download the "Build" folder
2. Double click "theif_project.exe"
